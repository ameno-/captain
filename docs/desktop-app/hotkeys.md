# Hotkeys

Configure keyboard shortcuts to quickly control Cap recordings. Access hotkey settings within the application's Settings menu.

## Default Hotkeys

*(Note: List default hotkeys here if known, otherwise provide examples)*

*   **Start/Stop Recording:** e.g., `Cmd+Shift+C` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+C` (Windows)
*   **Pause/Resume Recording:** e.g., `Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`
*   **Cancel Recording:** e.g., `Esc` (during countdown or setup)

## Customization

*   You can typically reassign these shortcuts to key combinations that work best for you.
*   Be mindful of conflicts with other application or system-wide shortcuts.

*(Implementation Note: Hotkey registration and handling are managed in the Tauri backend (`src-tauri/src/hotkeys.rs`).)*
