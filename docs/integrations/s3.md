# Custom S3 Storage

Configure the Cap desktop app to upload recordings directly to your own S3-compatible storage bucket. This is useful for compliance, data residency, or cost management.

## Configuration

Access the S3 configuration in the **Desktop App Settings > Integrations** section.

You will need to provide:

1.  **Provider:** Select your S3 provider (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Other).
2.  **Bucket Name:** The name of your S3 bucket.
3.  **Region:** The AWS region your bucket is located in (e.g., `us-east-1`).
4.  **Endpoint (Optional):** Required for S3-compatible services other than AWS S3 (e.g., `https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` for R2, or your MinIO endpoint). Leave blank for standard AWS S3.
5.  **Access Key ID:** Your S3 access key ID.
6.  **Secret Access Key:** Your S3 secret access key.

## Permissions Required

Ensure the provided Access Key has the necessary permissions on your bucket:

*   `s3:PutObject`: To upload video files, thumbnails, metadata.
*   `s3:GetObject`: Potentially needed for verification or listing (though primarily PutObject is essential for upload).
*   `s3:ListBucket` (Optional but recommended for testing): Allows the "Test Connection" feature to verify bucket access.
*   `s3:DeleteObject` (Optional): If Cap supports deleting self-hosted recordings from the app.

**It is highly recommended to create a dedicated IAM user or API token with *only* the necessary permissions scoped to the specific bucket.**

## Testing

Use the "Test Connection" button in the settings to verify Cap can access your bucket with the provided credentials.

*(Implementation Note: Configuration UI is in `s3-config.tsx`. Tauri backend handles saving and using these credentials in `upload.rs` and potentially `s3.ts`/`s3.rs` helpers.)*
