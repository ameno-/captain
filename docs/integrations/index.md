# Integrations

Connect Cap with other services.

*   **[S3-Compatible Storage](./s3.md):** Configure Cap to upload recordings to your own S3 bucket (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO) instead of Cap's default storage.
*   **[Discord](./discord.md):** (Details needed - likely notifications for new recordings, comments, or potentially slash commands).
*   **SSO (WorkOS):** Configure Single Sign-On for workspaces via WorkOS (Managed via Web Platform Workspace Settings).
