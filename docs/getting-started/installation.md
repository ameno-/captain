## First Launch & Permissions

Upon first launch, Cap (or the operating system) will likely ask for permissions:

*   **Screen Recording (macOS):** Essential for capturing your screen.
*   **Microphone:** Required to record your voice.
*   **Camera:** Required to record your webcam overlay.
*   **Accessibility (macOS, optional):** May be required for specific features like detecting window titles accurately or advanced controls.

Please grant these permissions for Cap to function correctly. You can usually manage these later in your system's Privacy & Security settings.
